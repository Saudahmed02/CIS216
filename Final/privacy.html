    <h3>Latest Update!</h3><br>

       <div class = "p">
            <p>Fortnite patch 18.40 has arrived, and the latest game update sees 
            the return of one of Fortnite's greatest weapons: mechs,
             which we haven't seen in-game since Chapter 1. The return of the Salvaged B.R.U.T.E.s 
             comes at a time when the Cube Queen
            is gearing up to unleash some special kind of chaos on the island.
