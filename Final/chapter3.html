            <p>Fortnite patch 18.40 has arrived, and the latest game update sees 
            the return of one of Fortnite's greatest weapons: mechs,
             which we haven't seen in-game since Chapter 1. The return of the Salvaged B.R.U.T.E.s 
             comes at a time when the Cube Queen
            is gearing up to unleash some special kind of chaos on the island.

        <h2>Things that you get started with!</h2>
        <h4>Story Line</h4>
        <p>Fortnite returned this morning for Chapter 3, Season 1—the 19th season of the popular battle royale game.

            Lots of fun new content and some very big gameplay changes promise to shake things up for players—at least those lucky enough to get into the game right now. Server queues and matchmaking issues appear to be a problem for many—including me.
            
            Still, once that’s sorted out we’ll have a bunch of new areas to explore and some cool new game mechanics like sliding and swinging to look forward to. Chapter 2 was getting pretty stale by the end and it was high time for a new map.
            
            During the Chapter 2 live-event ‘The End’ the Foundation (played by The Rock) and Jonesy saved the day by flipping the island and dunking the Cube Queen into the sea. The other side of the island is the new map, which is pretty clever.

                <p>A number of new gameplay items have been added in Fortnite’s third chapter. These include:</p>

                <dl>Tents.</dl> 
                <dd>You can use tents to heal up and to store items that can be used in future matches. This is the first time players have been able to save items for future matches.</dd>
                <dl>Victory Crowns.</dl> 
                <dd> This is basically all about bragging rights. If you win a match, you get a Victory Crown. If you wear it into the next match and win again, you can use a special emote to show off how many Crowned Victory Royales you have. Placing top 4 in solos, top 2 in Duos and #1 in Trios and Squads will get you a crown.</dd>
                <dl>Web-Shooters.</dl>
                <dd>These aren’t coming to the game until December 11th at 10am ET, but they’ll let you shoot webs and swing around on them like Spider-Man. Combined with the new sliding mechanic this should really make mobility fun this season.</dd>
                <dl>Med-Mist.</dl> 
                <dd>This is a healing spray cannister with 150 HP to spray on yourself or a teammate.</dd>
                <dl>Guzzle Juice.</dl> 
                <dd>Basically slurp juice but with a twist. While one bottle will slowly heal you to 100% health, taking damage while healing will halt the process.</dd>
                <dl>Vaults.</dl>
                <dd>You’ll need to open these with a teammate (or an enemy if you can communicate a truce). It’s part of the new emphasis on working together. You can revive or reboot teammates by having more than one player chip in also.</dd>
                <dl> Quadcrushers.</dl>   
                <dd>These sturdy, speedy little vehicles have been unvaulted, replacing Shopping Carts and ATKs.</dd>

        <h2>THE NEW FORTNITE MAP!</h2>
        <div class = "image">
        <img src = "map.jpg" atl = "Fortnite Map">
        <p>As you can see there are all sorts of new locations on the Chapter 3 map, including a desert biome, a tropical lagoon and a whole bunch of snow. It looks like Tilted Towers is buried in the snow and will slowly be revealed once it begins to melt. Most of the Named Locations are entirely new, however, including Camp Cuddle, Condo Canyon and The Daily Bugle.</p>

                    <dl>Ranger Assault Rifle.</dl> 
                    <dd>A medium-to-long range assault rifle that gives you a bit more accuracy at long range than this class typically offers.</dd>
                    <dl>MK-SEVEN Assault Rifle.</dl> 
                    <dd>This is a fun gun that I used to great effect in my Victory Royale match today. When you aim it zooms down the scope like a sniper rifle, putting you into first-person instead of third. Very useful!</dd>
                    <dl>Striker Pump Shotgun</dl>
                    <dd>This guy pumps out a very powerful spread of pellets.</dd>
                    <dl>Auto Shotgun</dl> 
                    <dd>Not as powerful as the Striker, but much faster. You even reload faster, loading two shells at a time.</dd>
                    <dl>Sidearm Pistol..</dl> 
                    <dd> Epic describes this as an accurate weapon that deals high damage at medium range and high headshot damage at close range.</dd>
                    <dl>Stinger SMG</dl>
                    <dd> As the name suggests, this one is a prickly, very fast-firing SMG designed for close-to-medium combat dealing high damage to enemy players and structures.</dd>
                    <dl>Hunter Bolt- Action Sniper.</dl>   
                    <dd>This is a great sniper rifle mainly because you can shoot three bullets before reloading. It’s not very fast but it gives you those extra couple of shots if you miss the first time. I won that match I talked about before with this gun, nabbing my 8th elimination by putting two bullets into the final opponent.</dd>
