        <h2>Chapter 2 Season 1</h2>
        <p>Chapter 2: Season 1, also known as Drop Into a <strong>New World</strong>, was the eleventh season of Fortnite: Battle Royale that started on October 15, 2019, and ended on February 20th, 2020, making it the longest season to date, with a length of 128 days (or 4 months), and the first Season to have 3 Seasonal Events (Winterfest, Fortnitemares, and Love and War).
            The theme is a new world and a new beginning, which was caused by the events of The End. 
            The cost of the Battle Pass for this season was 950 V-Bucks, like the previous 9 seasons.
            On v11.20, Epic Games announced that Chapter 2: Season 1 would end on February 6th, 2020, to prepare for the holidays with new features and a live event.
            Then, it happened again on January 24th, 2020, with the new date being February 20th, 2020. This is for Epic to reveal more of the season’s secrets and test out the new stuff.
            This is the longest season in Chapter 2 and the longest season overall lasting 128 days (4 months).</p>
        <h4>Welcome to Chapter 2 of FORTNITE!</h4>
        <p>However, despite what The Seven stated, The Black hole evaporated away after two days of The Blackout, forming a brand new Zero Point that reconstructed reality and reorganized the the previous island's matter into a new one, wiping the slate clean and beginning once again. The reason for The Black Hole ending is likely due to the transmission sent at the start of the season, likely originating from<strong>The Imagined Order></strong></p>

        <h2>Season 2</h2>
        <p>Chapter 2: Season 2, also known as Season 12 in the game files, with the slogan "Top Secret", was the twelfth season of Fortnite: Battle Royale, which started on February 20th, 2020, and ended on June 17th, 2020. (Close to 17 weeks).</p>

        <h4>Season 2 StoryLine</h4>
        <p>At the very start of Chapter 2: Season 2, Midas activated several sleeper agents battling loopers within The Loop. These included: Lynx, Bushranger, Brutus, Agent Peely, and even Journey. Furthermore, the appearance of Brutus as a Boss at The Grotto may suggest that he is a double agent, or he switched sides to fight for SHADOW. not long after his activation.</p>
        <p>TNTina join SHADOW, created an enormous explosion at The Rig, destroying the central area. Tons of trash and gallons of oil have spilled into the ocean and polluted the surrounding areas. Following the incident, SHADOW took over the location, converting it into their second base.</p>
        <p>Throughout the season, Midas had his daughter Jules work on constructing his Doomsday Device underneath The Agency, consisting of one large orb machine, and five pylons. The orb machine was hidden underneath the main building itself, while the pylons were underneath five newly-built hatches under the water surrounding The Agency. Midas wanted to destroy The Storm for unknown reason, which would subsequently cause the collapse of The Loop as the storm is somehow crucial for its existence (we don't know if this was part of his plan or not). Midas' project was going directly against The Imagined Order, who wanted to conserve The Loop and keep it running.</p>

        <h2>Season 3</h2>
        <p>Chapter 2: Season 3, also known as Season 13 in the game files, with the slogan "Splashdown!", was the thirteenth season of Fortnite: Battle Royale, which started on June 17th, 2020, and ended on August 26th, 2020.
            Previously the start date was going to be on April 30th, 2020, but was delayed multiple times to June 17th, 2020.
            The theme revolved around water, aquatics and summer.    
            This is the shortest season of Chapter 2. The second shortest season being the Chapter 2: Season 8 which is going to be 83 days.</p>
        <h4>Season 3 StoryLine</h4>
        <p>The new storm variation titled "The Wall of Water" caused by The Device (event) had collapsed, flooding the entire map.
        The introduction to the season begins with Midas sitting on a raft, looking dejected. A shark suddenly appears and attacks him as he tries to paddle away, presumably killing him. The audience then sees that Meowscles was in fact controlling this shark with a Fishing Rod while riding on skis. Meowscles flexes, and then passes a floating bar where Ocean was fighting Brutus, surrounded by spectators. Ocean uppercutted Brutus, knocking him out cold, while taking his helmet off in one blow. She caught the Helmet and waved to Meowscle passing by. As he returns a nod, Aquaman emerges on a giant Flopper to fist-bump him. The greetings end as Aquaman spots that they are about to crash; he points it out and leaves, just as Meowscles jumps from the water onto The Brat's barbecue to save himself from crashing. His skis - now on fire - cause him to burn a trail through the dock he jumped on, into an unluckily parked trailer. Meowscles bursts out the side holding Jellie as they land back into the water, extinguishing Meowscles' skis. Jellie yelps as Meowscles - still carrying him - navigates through floating piles of junk, until he skis off a ramp high into the air. Humorously, while doing this, he throws Jellie off of him. Meowscles lands on the newly-laid wall of the The Authority which Jules was still building, surprising both Aura and Cole. </p>

In order to stop the Black Winter from destroying Asgard and the universe, Thor becomes the Herald of Thunder and helps Galactus find 5 special planets to consume in order to stop the Black Winter. Galactus finds the rift above Catty Corner and the power of the Zero Point attracts him to it, so Thor enters the rift to warn it's inhabitants of the danger and to prepare to fight Galactus. Upon entering the island, he is confronted by Brite Bomber, Kit, Jonesy, Lynx, Peely, and Raven which Thor tries to talk to, in vain. The island slowly saps away part of Thor's memory, but upon seeing Galactus arriving in the distance he is reminded of his mission. He then sends his ravens to find help in his dimension, and in turn, the goddess also known as Lady Sif sends Storm, Iron Man, Captain America, Wolverine, She-Hulk, Mystique, Dr. Victor Von Doom, and Groot as well as the Helicarrier to appear via the Bifrost.</p>

Its theme revolved around The Zero Point and bounty hunters from different universes and realities, with the slogan "Join the Hunt" and the title Zero Point.</p>
        <p>Galactus, aka The Devourer of Worlds, made it to the Apollo island. He managed to unearth the Zero Point from underground, exposing it to the island. The Avengers managed to stop Galactus, however, the Zero Point became exposed and damaged, which caused a large sand area to appear in the center of the island with many crystal-like structures and remnants from the past.</p>

He decided to seek for the best hunters from all realities to help him in his quest.
            Rushing away, Jones did not hear an important piece of information - "do not draw the attention of The Seven".</p>
        <p>Throughout Chapter 2: Season 5 Jones jumped into other realities with a Portal Device, bringing his desired hunters. However, each reality jump caused The Zero Point to destabilize (Just like in Season 9), to the point at which Characters near it took notice</p>
