        <h2>Season 4</h2>
        <p>Season 4 of Fortnite: Battle Royale, with the slogan "Brace for Impact", started on May 1st, 2018, and ended on July 11th, 2018. You can see a full list with all cosmetics released in this season here.</p>
        <p>This season's theme was <strong>superheroes</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Season 4 Story Line</h4>
        <p>In Season 3, players saw a bright blue object in the sky. As it grew bigger and brighter over time in the sky, people realized it was a comet, heading straight towards the island. Telescopes and various signs were placed at high-altitude areas around the map, as the inhabitants prepared for its arrival. Small comet fragments began falling down around the island at the end of Season 3. When Season 4 launched, the comet slammed into the island, although it came in multiple fragments which impacted different regions around the map. By far the largest fragment slammed into the Factory unnamed POI, completely vapourizing the facility. The resulting impact and crater formed Dusty Divot, replacing Dusty Depot, which was severely damaged by the comet and thus renamed due to the massive crater. Several other smaller fragments fell around the island. One of them landed at Tilted Towers, pulverizing an entire building into rubble, another fragment decimated the Prison, and a third one landed directly at Risky Reels. It blew straight through the cinema screen and landed amongst the densely packed cars. Another tiny fragment landed at The Motel, although that impact was enough to flip a nearby bus and slam it into the motel roof.</p>
        
        <h2>Season 5</h2>
        <p>Season 5 was themed: World Collide. Drop into Season 5, where we’re introducing all kinds of changes to the map!  A viking ship, desert outpost, and ancient statues have appeared on the island, changing the world of Fortnite as we know it. On top of that, Fortnite’s first four person vehicle has arrived!

        <h4>Battle Pass</h4>
        <p>A new Season means an all new Battle Pass, packed with over 100 new rewards. It’s available right now in-game for 950 V-Bucks. Challenge your squad to a game of basketball or golf, or toss around a beach ball with friends. Make up your own game with all new toys!</p>

        <h2>Season 6</h2>
        <p>Season 6, with the slogan <strong> “Darkness Rises”</strong>, of Fortnite: Battle Royale started on September 27, 2018, and ended on December 5th, 2018.

            The theme revolves around Darkness and the Cube, just in time for the Halloween season.
            
            Season 6 was the first season to introduce pets and music to the game, as well as a new consumable, Shadow Stones. Changes to the map include the addition of corrupted areas, corn fields, Floating Island, and the Haunted Castle. You can find the full list of Cosmetics released this season here.</p>
        <h4>Short Story Line</h4>
        <h4>Season 6 continues the storyline that was started in Season 3.</h4>
        <p>Less than a day after Season 6 started, the cube began moving with the The Floating Island to the closest corruption zone, near Pleasant Park. Within three days, the cube reached the corruption zone and ripped out a chunk of land with the glyph imprinted on it, lifting it up into the air and sucking out energy from the corruption zone underneath the glyph, causing solid cube material to grow through the floating island. The process took some time, but once all the energy was sucked out from the corruption zone, the cube dropped the glyph and moved on, heading towards the next corruption zone. Throughout nearly a month, the cube visited all six corruption zones on the map, and grew through the house on the Floating Island. The final corruption zone that the cube visited was the central zone, and during the process, all other six glyphs around the island lifted from their corruption zones and began moving towards the Floating Island, each one suspended in the air by a vortex. At this point, the cube material had grown through the entire floating island and the house on to When the glyphs reached the Floating Island, the cube began absorbing their energy simultaneously. When the cube was done, the glyphs 'deactivated' and crashed down onto the ground. Their purple colours turned to a darker brown colour, signifying that the cube had stripped them completely of their energy.</p>
        
        <h2>Season 7</h2>
        <p>Season 7, with the slogan “You Better Watch Out”, is the seventh season of Fortnite: Battle Royale which started on December 6th, 2018 and ended on February 28th, 2019.
            The supposed end date was on February 14th, 2019, but was postponed by 2 weeks due to Epic Games’ holiday break.
            The theme revolves around the Holidays, especially Christmas.
            By purchasing the Battle Pass, players were given early access to Creative mode, 1 week before everyone else on December 13th, 2018.
            You can find the full list of cosmetics released in this season here.</p>
        <h4>Season 7 was start of something NEW!</h4>
        <p>Season 7 started a new storyline, separate from the storyline that had been happening since Season 3. The corruption zones had completely faded away by the time the Iceberg spotted in late Season 6 collided with the southwest side of the island, burying Greasy Grove under mounds of ice and completely destroying Flush Factory. Three new locations were brought in with the Iceberg, Happy Hamlet, a small town for the inhabitants of the Iceberg, Polar Peak, a large ice mountain containing a mysterious tower, and Frosty Flights, the headquarters of The Arctic Force, a military faction commanded by Sgt. Winter, who takes his orders from The Ice King, the entity responsible for controlling The Iceberg. Following the Iceberg's collision with the island, The Arctic Force invaded the island using Slushy Soldiers and X-4 Stormwing planes, setting up numerous Expedition Outposts throughout the island.</p>
        
        <h2>Season 8</h2>
        <p>Season 8 of Fortnite: Battle Royale started on February 28th, 2019, and ended on May 8th, 2019.
            The theme revolves mainly on <strong>Adventure, Pirates and the Jungle</strong>. You can find the full list of cosmetics released this season here.</p>
        
        <h4>Season 8 StoryLine</h4>
        <p>Little storyline activity occured throughout the season, with only the destroyed Tilted Towers building being rebuilt into a No Sweat Insurance office. However, sometime during the season, the Unnamed Investigation Agency returned. They set up a small dig-site near Fatal Fields and enclosed it with a fence. However, after digging into the ground with the excavator, the UIA only unearthed a volcano vent which suddenly burst out of the ground. During this time, a UIA helicopter began searching around the map, moving from location to location. Following the failure of the first dig-site, a second dig-site was constructed at the center of the abandoned facility in Dusty Divot. As with the first site, the second one also ended up as a failure, only unearthing a small pool of underground magma. A third dig-site was established near Loot Lake, and finally, they found it. A mysterious and unbreakable sheet of metal was located underground, and the UIA began moving all of their equipment to Loot Lake, including the helicopter.
        </p>
        <p>The next day, a massive excavation site occurred at Loot Lake, where up to 10 UIA excavators dug up all the land in the center of the lake. The waterfalls, grass, and cube pieces were all removed, while multiple buildings were constructed and lots of UIA cars, lorries, and cranes arrived. What the excavators unearthed was The Vault, a large and mysterious metal hatch surrounded by five big locks with metal slots.</p>
        <p>Several days later, a holographic image of a glyph appeared above one of the vault locks (visibly different in appearance to The Cube glyphs). Around the same time, a large metallic 'key' appeared north of Lucky Landing, with the exact same glyph above it as the one at The Vault. It was during this time period, that loopers realized that the key must be inserted into The Vault slot actively projecting the glyph, and the glyphs themselves depicted what must be done to insert the key. In this instance, loopers must hit it with their pickaxes in order to move the vault. It took some time and effort, but the key eventually reached The Vault and slid into its hatch, activating the lock. This activity also seemed to somehow affect the magma underneath the island, causing The Volcano to start to emit smoke. The other four keys each had various and separate tasks that loopers had to complete in order to insert them into the lake. Eventually, though, the loopers accomplished the mission and all the locks were activated. However, each activation of a lock worsened the condition of the volcano, and by the time all the keys were inserted, lava was violently spewing out of the volcano with the ground vigorously shaking in its vicinity.</p>
        <p>A 24-hour countdown for <strong>The Unvaulting Event</strong> appeared on May 3rd 2019.</p>

        <h2>Season 9</h2>
        <p>Season 9 of Fortnite: Battle Royale started on May 9th, 2019, and ended on August 1st, 2019 at 84 days (roughly 3 months), with Chapter 2: Season 1 being the longest at 128 days (4 months.)
            This season revolved mainly around the Future and Sci-Fi. You can find the full list of cosmetics released in this season here.</p>
        <h4>Season 9 StoryLine</h4>
        <p>The impact of the Volcano's fireball to polar peak seemed minor at first, but it caused severe damage to the integrity of the mountain, and awakened something big inside of it. Over the course of the next few weeks, the ice at Polar Peak began cracking apart and melting even further, eventually revealing a giant eye belonging to The Devourer, a powerful monster locked away and frozen by The <strong>Ice King</strong>.</p>
        <p>On Week 5 of the season, The Devourer broke out of Polar Peak, destroying the castle and half of the mountain. Judging by the footsteps left behind by The Devourer, after breaking out of the mountain, the monster headed west and went into The Ocean. During this time period, the monster could be seen swimming around the island.</p>
        <p>Within the next two weeks, The Devourer returned to the island several times, destroying the northern-most Snobby Shores house, the modern house in Pleasant Park, and the western Loot Lake research buildings. In his path of destruction in Loot Lake, The Devourer also damaged the power chord leading to Neo Tiled, ripping off its outer casing and showing its interior wires.</p>
        <p>Following these destructive events, Singularity partnered with the UIA to use Pressure Plant to construct the Mecha Team Leader to fight the robot. Pressure Plant was soon taken apart, and a new layout built for construction of the Mecha. Meanwhile, around the island, holographic propoganda signs began appearing in areas to help promote support for the mecha construction.</p>
        <p>Mecha Team Leader finally finished construction at Pressure Plant after two weeks of building. The robot was painted in a range of different colours, as a countdown for The Final Showdown event appeared, an event that would end in victory, or the complete destruction of the island.</p>
    
        <h2>Season X - THE FINAL SHOWDOWN</h2>
        <p>When the countdown for The Final Showdown reached zero, The Devourer entered the island near Lazy Lagoon, sweeping a pirate camp out of its way and blasting its surroundings with a huge beam of energy radiating from its mouth. The monster proceeded to head to Loot Lake, where it attempted to punch its way through the locked hatch. It was at this moment that the mecha activated, piloted by Singularity, and distracted the monster from The Vault. After the robot launched two batches of missiles at the Devourer, the creature retaliated by blasting the mecha with an energy beam. After recovering from the strong attack by the monster, the robot sprinted at the monster and boosted into it, lifting it into the air and off the map. After some time, the robot emerged from the water and went back onto the map, seemingly victorious. However, in a plot twist, the monster leapt out of the water and landed on the robot, knocking it to the ground. In the ensuing carnage, The Mecha threw off The Devourer, but was severely damaged with his left arm missing, causing him to collapse on top of Loot Lake. As the monster got back on its feet, Singularity realized that if she failed, The Devourer would break into The Vault and consume The Zero Point, causing reality to collapse and an end-of-the-world scenario. In a desperate last attempt to kill The Devourer, The Mecha punched through The Vault hatch, grabbing The Zero Point and tearing it out of containment, lifting it out of The Vault and cracking its outer shell, absorbing its inner energy. As the monster readied up for another attack, Mecha destroyed The Vault hatch by punching through it, tearing The Zero Point out of containment and lifting it out of The Vault. It then proceeded to crack its outer shell, absorbing its energy. When The Devourer attacked again, Mecha set The Zero Point back down and punched the monster round the head, sending it tumbling backwards. With its newfound energy, Mecha approached the singularity statue at Neo Tilted and grabbed it, pulling it out. As the monster slowly regained strength and got back on its feet, the statue was revealed to be a sword called The Sword Of Singularity. Now, the Mecha charged the sword with The Zero Point energy and faced the monster in a final showdown. As the two leapt at each other, The Mecha stabbed the sword through The Devourer's head, finally killing it once and for all. As the monster's corpse quickly decomposed due to The Zero Point energy, leaving behind bare skeletal parts, Mecha Team Leader boosted into the sky and disappeared along with Singularity, never reappearing again as of Chapter 2: Season 8.</p>
        <p>However, the battle left behind a major problem. The Zero Point was now out of containment and located above the destroyed Vault hatch at Loot Lake. Within the next few days, The Zero Point rapidly destabilized, starting to pulse rapidly with energy and radiate lots of energy from the cracks on its outer shell. This energy corrupted a nearby tree, causing it's leaves to change color to orange. By that time it was clear, The Zero Point was here to stay...</p>
